USER STORY :

1. Business Analyst
Title: Enhancing Game Development Strategy through Market Analysis

User Story:
As a business analyst in the gaming industry, I want to utilize the "Interactive Genre and Year Selection for Tailored Game Recommendations" dashboard to analyze historical sales data by genre and publisher. This will enable me to identify which genres have been most lucrative over different periods and how various publishers have performed historically. By understanding these trends, I can advise on potential gaps in the market or areas for investment to optimize our future game development and publishing strategies.

2. Data Analyst
Title: Data-Driven Insights for Game Popularity and Sales Trends

User Story:
As a data analyst, I need to use the "Top 10 Video Games" and "How have Genres changed over the years?" sections of the dashboard to extract detailed insights on sales performance across different game titles and their genres over time. This will help me create detailed reports and forecasts about emerging trends, enabling our company to adapt quickly to changes in consumer preferences. The insights will also support the business analyst in making informed recommendations for strategic directions.

3. Marketing/Video Game Publisher
Title: Targeted Marketing Campaigns Based on Regional Preferences and Historical Data

User Story:
As a marketing professional for a video game publishing company, I need to analyze the "Genres by Choice" and regional sales data provided in the dashboard to tailor our marketing campaigns. By understanding which genres are popular in specific regions and how these preferences have evolved, I can design targeted promotions, adjust marketing spend, and optimize the timing of game releases to maximize engagement and sales. This strategic use of data will directly impact our market penetration and revenue in different geographical areas.

These stories emphasize how different roles within a company can use the same data presented in the dashboard to support various aspects of business operations, strategy, and marketÂ engagement.
